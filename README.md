For my final group project at Prime Digital Academy, I was on a team that made this app for Twin Cities PBS. I took the role of front-end designer and also tackled some client-side logic.<br>

The project, which was completed over 3 weeks, allows employees to schedule meeting rooms on-the-fly, rather than make the trek back to their desks to properly sign up with Microsoft Outlook. It was meant as a proof-of-concept for TPT, so it was demonstrated with Google Calendar. For actual implementation, their team is altering the code to work with Outlook.

You can find a working demo at https://tpt-demo.herokuapp.com and you can see the calendar in action at https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tpt.roomer%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Chicago <br>

There is one big caveat to playing around with this app. Sometimes it reqires a login, usually it doesn't. This is a symptom of using Google for the demo impementation. If it asks for a login, I'll have to demonstrate it in person. <br>

Technologies I employed for my part of this project:<br>
  • HTML/CSS <br>
  • Bootstrap <br>
  • Javascript<br>
  
The primary lessons of this assignment were: <br>
  • "Long-term" small team collaboration and specialization <br>
  • Client interactions (that ended up being my job) <br>
  • Creating a scope of work and getting approval <br>
  • Formally presenting the finished product <br>
